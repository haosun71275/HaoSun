<h2 id="PI"> Personal Information </h2>

I got my Ph.D degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagin in 2018 (advisor: Prof. Bergvelt, Maarten). After that I was a postdoc at Sun Yat-Sen University (mentor: Prof. Li, Changzheng), and now I am an assistant professor at Souch China University of Technology. My primary research interest is algebraic geometry. When I was Ph.D, I focused on Hurwitz number. Now I am working on Higgs bundles and its related field from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry.
