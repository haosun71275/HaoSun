<h2 id="PI"> Personal Information </h2>

I got my Ph.D degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/) in 2018 (advisor: Prof. Bergvelt, Maarten). After that I was a postdoc at [Sun Yat-Sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) (mentor: Prof. Li, Changzheng), and now I am an assistant professor at [Souch China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). My primary research interest is algebraic geometry. In my Ph.D program, I focused on Hurwitz number. Now I am working on Higgs bundles and its related field from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry.
