<h2 id="PI"> About Me </h2>

I got my Ph.D degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/) in 2018 (advisor: Prof. Bergvelt, Maarten). After that I was a postdoc at [Sun Yat-Sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) (mentor: Prof. Li, Changzheng), and now I am an assistant professor at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). My primary research interest is algebraic geometry. In my Ph.D program, I focused on Hurwitz number. Now I am working on Higgs bundles and some related problems.

<h2 id="Teach"> Teaching </h2>
The teaching experience can be found in my CV, and I would like to share some of my (short) notes here for convenience of students.
